## Description

`chatterbox` is a tool to compose RESTful conversations with a
generic endpoint.

You can define scenarios with a yaml formalism describing conversations
between the client (chatterbox) and the endpoint.

`chatterbox` could be useful to you when you have to:

- Prototype a RESTful protocol
- Investigate and/or probe a RESTful endpoint
- Develop a RESTful endpoint with a test-driven methodology
- Develop system tests for a RESTful endpoint

### Scripting capabilities

`chatterbox` embeds [V8](https://v8.dev/) the Googleâ€™s open source
high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine.

This allows the user to define scenarios in a dynamic way.
For example, you could choose to compute the value of a certain
input's field as the result of a user defined JavaScript function.

More use cases could benefit from scripting capabilities and these could
be evaluated in the future as the tool evolves.

## Build requirements

Currently, `chatterbox` can be solely built under Linux.

If you wish to build the `chatterbox` binary directly on your Linux
distribution, ensure your system provides all the required dependencies.

## How to build

First, ensure you have checked out all the `chatterbox`'s submodules:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Build

Build the `chatterbox` binary alongside with all its dependencies:

```shell
cd scripts
./build.sh build-all
```

### Build using a Dockerfile builder image

It is possible to use a Dockerfile builder image to compile the binary
of `chatterbox`.

- `scripts/Dockerfile.builder`

To build `chatterbox` with a Dockerfile builder image, your system needs
to provide Podman or Docker.

To create the `chatterbox` builder image:

```shell
cd scripts
./build.sh builder-create
```

```shell
$ podman images

REPOSITORY                                  TAG
localhost/chatterbox-builder                latest
```

With this image, it is possible to build the `chatterbox` binary:

```shell
cd scripts
./build.sh builder-build
```

Once you have built the `chatterbox` binary, you can create the
final consumable chatterbox image:

```shell
cd scripts
./build.sh chatterbox-create
```

```shell
$ podman images

REPOSITORY                                 TAG
localhost/chatterbox                       latest
```

## Usage

A typical usage scenario is to write your scenarios on files
and then submit them to `chatterbox`.

Once you have your scenario ready, you can submit it to `chatterbox` with:

```shell
chatterbox -f scenario.yaml
```

You can specify indifferently a relative or an absolute path.
If you want, you can also specify a relative path from where files are read.

```shell
chatterbox -p /scenarios -f scenario.yaml
```

## Input/Output concepts

`chatterbox` adopts the main concept that the input provided by
the user is the template used to render the output. The output
keeps the same format of the input, eventually enriched.

Conceptually, the input is unwound by the `chatterbox`'s engine
to produce the final rendered output.
Each response in the input is inserted in the output
at the proper place. All the modifications operated by JavaScript
functions are rendered in the output as well.

### Input/Output example

#### Input

```yaml
conversations:
  - host: localhost:8080
    requests:
      - method: DELETE
        uri: foo/bar
```

#### Possible rendered output

```yaml
conversations:
  - host: 'localhost:8080'
    requests:
      - method: DELETE
        uri: foo/bar
        response:
          code: 401
          rtt: 0
          body: 'unauthorized'
    stats:
      requests: 1
      categorization:
        401: 1
stats:
  conversations: 1
  requests: 1
  categorization:
    401: 1
```

## chatterbox scenario format

The chatterbox scenario format is pretty straightforward:
it is a yaml defining properties for the scenarios you want to realize.

### Scenario context

At the root context, or `scenario` context, you define an array of `conversations`:

```yaml
conversations:
  - host: 'http://service1.host1.domain1'
    requests:
  - host: 'https://service2.host2.domain2'
    requests:
```

This means that the tool can issue requests against multiple endpoints.

### Conversation context

A `conversation` is defined as an array of `requests`(s):

```yaml
requests:
  - method: HEAD
  - method: GET
  - method: PUT
  - method: POST
  - method: DELETE
```

### Request context

A `request` describes a single `HTTP` request.

```yaml
 for : 1
 auth : aws_v2
 method : PUT
 uri : foo
 queryString: param=value
 data: something
 response : {}
```

You can repeat a `request` for `n` times specifying the `for` attribute
in the request's context.

### Response context

A rendered `response` contains the response for a single `request`.

```yaml
code: 200
body: OK
```

### Dumps and Formats

At every context in the input is always possible to define
an `out` node describing what should be rendered in the output.

Valid contexts are:

- `scenario`
- `conversation`
- `request`
- `response`

Suppose that this fragment is inserted inside a `response` context in the
input:

```yaml
out:
  dump:
    body: true
  format:
    body: json
```

This means that in the corresponding output context, the `body` field
should be rendered and it should be rendered as `json`.

## Scripting

Every time a scenario runs, a brand new JavaScript context is spawned
into `V8` engine and it lasts for the whole scenario's life.

### Field's value

Generally speaking, all the fields in the input object can be scripted
defining JavaScript functions that are executed to obtain a value.

For example, the `queryString` attribute of a `request` could be defined
as this:

```yaml
auth: aws_v2
method: HEAD
uri: bar
queryString:
  function: getQueryString
  args: [bar, 41, false]
```

When the scenario runs, the `queryString` attribute's value is
evaluated as a JavaScript function named: `getQueryString`
taking 3 parameters.

The `getQueryString` function must be defined inside a file with
extension `.js` and placed into the directory where `chatterbox` reads
its inputs.

```javascript
function getQueryString(p1, p2, p3) {
  if(p3){
    return "foo=default"
  }
  log(TLV.INF, "getQueryString", "Invoked with: " + p1 + "," + p2);
  return "foo=" + p1 + p2;
}
```

### Context lifecycle handlers

At every context activation, `chatterbox` can invoke, if defined, the corresponding
`before` and `after` handlers.

Valid contexts, where this mechanism works, are:

- `scenario`
- `conversation`
- `request`
- `response`

For example, to define these handlers in the scenario context:

```yaml
before:
  function: onScenarioBefore
  args: [one, 2, three]
after:
  function: onScenarioAfter
  args: [1, two, 3]
conversations: []
```

You would also define the corresponding functions in the JavaScript:

```Javascript
function onScenarioBefore(outCtx, p1, p2, p3) {
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioBefore", "parameter-1: " + p1);
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioBefore", "parameter-2: " + p2);
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioBefore", "parameter-3: " + p3);

  //set an optional tag in the contextual object passed as first argument
  outCtx.optionalTag = "my-custom-tag";
}

function onScenarioAfter(outCtx, p1, p2, p3) {
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioAfter", "parameter-1: " + p1);
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioAfter", "parameter-2: " + p2);
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioAfter", "parameter-3: " + p3);

  //read the optional tag we set before
  log(TLV.INF, "onScenarioAfter", "optionalTag: " + outCtx.optionalTag);
}
```

Note these handlers are called by `chatterbox` with the first argument:
`outCtx` always set to the contextual yaml node where the handler is defined.

### Global objects

In the JavaScript environment you can access and manipulate a series of
global objects automatically set by `chatterbox`.

Currently, you can access and manipulate the following objects:

- `out`

This object represents the current state of the output. You can access
any of its properties and also modify or add entries.

#### Example

If during the execution of a scenario the control reaches
a JavaScript function: `someFunction`; inside that, you can
manipulate the `out` global object:

```javascript
function someFunction() {
  out.someTag1 = "myTag1";
  out.someTag2 = 2;

  log(TLV.INF, "someFunction", "out.someTag1: " + out.someTag1);
  log(TLV.INF, "someFunction", "out.someTag2: " + out.someTag2);
}
```

This would have the effect to produce an output object enriched with:

```yaml
conversations: []
someTag1: myTag1
someTag2: 2
```

### Global functions

In the JavaScript environment you can invoke a series of
functions automatically set by `chatterbox`.

Currently, you can invoke the following functions:

- `log`

```javascript
let TLV = {
  TRC: 0,
  DBG: 1,
  INF: 2,
  WRN: 3,
  ERR: 4,
  CRI: 5,
  OFF: 6,
}

function someFunction() {
  log(TLV.INF, "someFunction", "lorem ipsum");
}
```

- `load`

```javascript
load("include.js")
```

- `assert`

```javascript
function someFunction(outCtx) {
  assert("someFunction [code]", outCtx.code == 200);
}
```
